###How to get started
In order to run this app, you need to have Node.js installed. If you don't, install it through the official website: http://nodejs.org/. You will also need Ruby and Compass correctly installed (Mac OS users don't have to install Ruby)

Clone the project and, in the project folder, run the following in the terminal
```
npm install
bower install
```

**That's it**. Now, you can run the client in serve mode with the following command:
```
grunt serve
```

The browser will open and the app will run on ```http://localhost:9000/```

###How to build the project

If you want to build the project (distributable version), run
```
grunt build
```

The resulting files will be in the ```dist``` folder.
