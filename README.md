###How to get started
In order to run this app, you need to have Node.js installed. If you don't, install it through the official website: http://nodejs.org/. You will also need Ruby and Compass correctly installed (Mac OS users don't have to install Ruby)

```
npm install
bower install
```

**That's it**. Now, you can run the client in serve mode with the following command:
```
grunt serve
```

The browser will open and the app will run on ```http://localhost:9000/```

###How to build the project
